  <h1 align="center" style="color: white; font-size: 50px;">What Is Celtec Games?</h1>

  <p align="center" style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"><br>Celtec Games is a small company based in Wrexham, North East Wales, UK. We strive to showcase our
talent and passion for gaming by creating original games<br>that inspire the minds of our audience. Our games are suitable for players of all
ages and backgrounds, and no one is left out or ignored. Every game we have published has a vision behind it.<br> A vision that discovers and
embraces themes that resonate with us and our audience. Quality takes priority over quantity in our  games, and we clearly express that through elements in them.</p>

  <p align="center" style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"><br>We reached where we are today by raising the game, empowering the people and
raising the passion to make the greatest cross platform games in the country!</p>


  <h1 align="center" style="color: white; font-size: 50px;"><br>Revolutionising The Industry, One Step At A Time</h1>

  <p align="center" style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"><br>Our goal is not only inspiring the people who play our games, but the gaming industry as a whole.
We are aiming to make a positive impact on the current and future state of gaming, whi-<br>-le making a name for ourselves in the process. The only way in which we shall
achieve this is through sheer dedication, hard work and a burning passion for video game development.</p>

  <p align="center" style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"><br>One thing most people hate about modern day gaming is the lack of cross-platform compatibility for games
and their inconsistent quality between version releases. This is where we step in. All of our currently released games, as well as our upcoming projects rectify this
ongoing issue in 2 ways. First of all, every one of our games are available on all major platorms, allowing all users of different kinds to experience our content
on their respective devices. Second of all, we play and test our own games to the extreme, digging to even the deepest depths, in order to discover and eliminate
bugs that can hinder user experience.</p>
