  <p align="center" style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"><br>We were never a gaming company in the past. Decades ago, Celtec Games was nothing more than a simple 
software developer who strived to make a fun user experience for popular utility software. During this time, gaming as a whole was not mainstream and software
was only designed purely to make specific task easier and more simple. After the passing of the Video Game Crash of 1977, gaming started to play an important major role
in the entertainment industry. We at Celtec Games noticed this shift and we decided to switch our priorities from utility software to the fast-growing market of video games.</p>

  <p align="center" style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"><br>Fast forward to 2025 and the current and future state of the company and video games as a whole has taken a
massive turn for the better. We have become the Celtec Games we wanted to be over the course of decades, thanks to huge events that occurred over the years, as well as the
suport of our players and fans!<br><br></p>
